title: The SICP Challenge
---

I've been a "software engineer" for about six years now. After six years of learning everything I could to find me a better job, I have found that, in a lot of senses we, the so called "software engineers", might not be that much of an engineer, we certainly like programming and make useful stuff, but I've found generalized the dislike for math. Engineering is about applying **scientific knowledge** to solve problems, but most of the time I found myself trying to solve a problem the way an artisan would solve it: by pure instinct, with a lot of trial and error and a less of *scientific thinking*.

That's why I'm challenging myself with the problems of the book: [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) (SICP) in order to keep myself motivated in this new path to a stronger CS education. I hope this experiment works so I can keep doing the same with even harder books I've got into my shelve such as "The Elements Of Programming" or "Concrete Mathematics".

I'll be posting the solutions to the exercises as I do them and keep a log of the exercises I can't solve, or couldn't solve without help.

Let's get started!
