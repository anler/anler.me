title: The SICP Challenge
---

I've been a "software engineer" for about six years. After six years of learning everything I could to find me a better job, I have found that in a lot of senses we, the "engineers", are anything but engineers, we certainly like programming and make useful stuff, but do not like science and/or math. Engineering is about applying **scientific knowledge** to solve problems, but most of the time I found my self trying to solve a problem the way an artisan would solve it: by pure instinct, without any scientific thinking being applied.

That's why I'm challenging myself with the problems of the book: [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) (SICP) to keep myself motivated in trying to fill the gap between my practical and theoretical skills. I hope this experiment works so I can keep doing the same with even harder books I've got into my shelve.

I'll be posting the solutions to the exercises as I do them and keep a log of the exercises I couldn't solve, or couldn't solve without help.

Let's get started!

# Chapter 1 - Building Abstractions with Procedures

[Ex 1.1](/sicp/1.1.html), [Ex 1.2](/sicp/1.2.html), [Ex 1.3](/sicp/1.3.html), [Ex 1.4](/sicp/1.4.html), [Ex 1.5](/sicp/1.5.html), [Ex 1.6](/sicp/1.6.html), [Ex 1.7](/sicp/1.7.html)
