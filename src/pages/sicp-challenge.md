title: The SICP Challenge
---

I'm challenging myself with the problems of the book: [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) (SICP) to keep myself motivated. I'll be posting the solutions of the exercises as I do them and keep a log of the exercises I couldn't solve without help.

# Chapter 1 - Building Abstractions with Procedures

[Ex 1.1](/sicp/1.1.html), [Ex 1.2](/sicp/1.2.html), [Ex 1.3](/sicp/1.3.html), [Ex 1.4](/sicp/1.4.html), [Ex 1.5](/sicp/1.5.html)
