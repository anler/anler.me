## Sobre mi

Hello, my name is Anler Hern√°ndez Peral, I'm a software engineer specialized in full-stack web
development, with years of experience in Python, PHP, and Javascript.

I was born in Havana Cuba in 1986 where I spent most of my youth and move to Spain at the age of 21
where I began working as a software engineer.

Currently I'm working as a full-time fronted web developer using Angular and fascinated by Haskell,
Abstract Algebra and Category Theory.

I love all kind of music, from jazz to salsa going through stoner, blues and funk. If you are in
Madrid and you're up to taste some damn good craft beer, let me know!
