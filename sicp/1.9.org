title: SICP: Exercise 1.9
---

Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two positive integers in terms of the procedures ~inc~, which increments its argument by 1, and ~dec~, which decrements its argument by 1.

First:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
  (define (+ a b)
    (if (= a 0)
        b
        (inc (+ (dec a) b))))
#+END_SRC

Second:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
  (define (+ a b)
    (if (= a 0)
        b
        (+ (dec a)
           (inc b))))
#+END_SRC

Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each procedure in evaluated ~(+ 4 5)~. Are these processes iterative or recursive?

* Solution
** First
This solution uses a *linear recursive process*. It's recursive because the process is illustrated as a chain of deferred operations.
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
  (+ 4 5)

  (inc (+ 3 5))

  (inc (inc (+ 2 5)))

  (inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))

  (inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))

  (inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))

  (inc (inc (inc 6)))

  (inc (inc 7))

  (inc 8)

  9
#+END_SRC

** Second
This solution uses a *linear iterative process*. It's iterative because each step's state is completely captured by state variables along with the fixed rule dictating how the state variables should update (which is =a ← a - 1= and =b ← b + 1=).
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
  (+ 4 5)

  (+ 3 6)

  (+ 2 7)

  (+ 1 8)

  (+ 0 9)

  9
#+END_SRC
